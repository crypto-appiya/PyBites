Let's learn Python with some coding. A simple program like this can give us tons of knowledge. Read the instructions carefully and find the answer(s) along with a description. Believe me, you will get to know new ways of problem-solving:

Instructions:


Write a function that can sum up numbers:

It should receive a sequence of n numbers.
If no argument is provided, return sum of numbers 1..100.
Look closely to the type of the function's default argument ...
Here is the template:


def sum_numbers(numbers=None):
  pass
The usual solution:


def sum_numbers(numbers=None):
    sum = 0
    if numbers == None:
        for num in range(1,101):
            sum += num
    else:
        for num in numbers:
            sum += num
            
    return sum
Python is flexible and one can write, simple yet powerful code in fewer lines. Hence the above problem can be solved as:


def sum_numbers(numbers=None):
  if numbers == None:
    numbers = range(101) 
  
  return sum(numbers)
function sum_numbers() has a default parameter that sets data to None if no data is passed. In such a case, the function will return the addition of 1 to 100 numbers. The range() function in Python returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number. The value given (101 in this case) is exclusive and wonâ€™t be considered (Remember, Between-And operator in SQL?).  

Python has many built-in functions. Developers can take advantage of functions such as sum(), min(), max(), len() and apply them to a list, tuple, set, or dictionary.

You may use inline 'if' and write the above code as:


def sum_numbers(numbers=None):
  return sum(numbers) if numbers else sum(range(101))
You may try:

Sum of odd numbers with the same instructions

Try to find the maximum of sum values of even and odd

Print the numbers in reverse order.

Have a fun!
